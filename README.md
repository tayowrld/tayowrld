# Ivan Kurbakov, 19 yo.

### About.

I'm interested in Web applications development and software engineering. Since the age of 8 I've started learning and improoving my programming and designing skills, so now I'm practicing.

19 years old at the moment and beside of programming, I'm crazy about singing, making videos, learning english (for today I'm approximatly at B1 level).

Also I have a very lovely girlfriend, she is literally my inspiration.

Then, when you looked a little closer into me, you can see my stats then. Have a good day.
